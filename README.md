# Garrett's Static Web Template

A solid reusable web template.

- babel transpilation with ES2015 defaults
- live reloading with html injection
- sass
- templates and partials with mustache js
- html5 boilerplate


## TODO

- ~~Add image task~~
- ~~Add support for partials~~
- Add JS injection that retains app state. Maybe move to webpack from browsersync?
- Add and test mixins
- Make this into a yeoman generator
